# ObesityTrend-LinearRegression
ObesityTrend-LR predicts population obesity rates with simple linear regression. It pivots CDC BRFSS data, uses food-, drink-, and activity-related percentages as features, imputes gaps, trains the model, outputs RÂ²/RMSE, and plots actual vs. predicted values for quick insight into lifestyle-obesity trends.
